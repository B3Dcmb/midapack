** Log: toeplitz*.c
**
** Revision 1.0b  2012/05/07  Frederic Dauvergne (APC)
** Official release 1.0beta. The first installement of the library is the Toeplitz algebra
** module.
**
** Revision 1.1b  2012/07/-  Frederic Dauvergne (APC)
** - mpi_stbmm allows now rowi-wise order per process datas and no-blocking communications.
** - OMP improvment for optimal cpu time.
** - bug fixed for OMP in the stmm_basic routine.
** - distcorrmin is used to communicate only lambda-1 datas when it is needed.
** - new reshaping routines using transformation functions in stmm. Thus, only one copy
**   at most is needed.
** - tpltz_init improvement using define_nfft and define_blocksize routines.
** - add Block struture to define each Toeplitz block.
** - add Flag structure and preprocessing parameters to define the computational strategy.
**   All the flag parameters are then available directly from the API.
