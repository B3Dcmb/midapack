How to install it
-----------------

Build the Library:

In a generic use, Midapack requires few libraries : mpi, openmp and fftw3.
Ensure these libraries are available on your system. To build the library,
Just do :
./configure
make


The configure script generate several Makefiles for /src and /test.
For more specific purpose, you can also define some other options for the configure
script. For example, if you want to generate the sequential/openmp midapack librairy, do :
./configure --without mpi

For more details on theses options do :
./configure --help

Then you can build the librairy from the sources by doing make as usual.
the library file is then stored in ./lib directory. His name will be midapack.a or
seqmidapack.a depending on your configure option choices.
To use it, you also need the Midapack include file stored in the /include directory.



Build the examples:

To build the examples binaries for the library, do :
- make mapmat_example  to generate the examples from the mapmat module
- make toeplitz_example to generate the examples from the Toeplitz module

Some of theses examples need some specific libraries to be install.
So, check the generated Makefiles in /test and modify it depending on your system.
In particular, you need to set properly the library path for FFTW.
