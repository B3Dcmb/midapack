Midapack library, ANR MIDAS'09 - release 1.1b, July 2012.
(http://www.apc.univ-paris7.fr/APC_CS/Recherche/Adamis/MIDAS09/index.html)

ACKNOWLEDGMENT: This work has been supported in part by French National Research Agency (ANR)
through COSINUS program (project MIDAS no. ANR-09-COSI-009).


Motivation
----------

The aim of the CMB DA library is to provide high performance, massively parallel, and 
portable analysis tools suitable for Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data analysis 
and thus addressing the existing gap between the low level numerical libraries, such as 
FFTW, SCALAPACK, LAPACK, PLASMA, etc, and high level tools needed to analyze actual CMB data.

The library is designed to provide all essential functionality needed for the CMB data analysis.
It will include new algorithm solutions and their implementation, capable of dealing with the 
huge data volumes, while giving the user flexibility in constructing his/her own codes
according to their preferences and instrument and data characteristics.

How to use it
-------------

This software is reported to work on several Linux distributions and should work on any
modern Unix-like system after minimal porting efforts.

The source code is delivered in a set of directories:

- The /src directory contains the sources files for the core library. It's composed by the
differents modules of the Midapack library (please refer to the website for more details). 
You can directly compile theses files and link the generated binaries with your own program.

- The /test directory contains some Utility/demonstration programs to show some examples of
how to use the library fonctionnalities.
