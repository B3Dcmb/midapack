The goal of the {\bfseries M\-I\-D\-A\-S} project is to provide high performance, middle-\/layer software tools, which would aid C\-M\-B data analysis efforts of current and planned C\-M\-B experiments to capitalize on the computational power of parallel (super)computers. The functionality provided by the library is supposed to fill in the gap in between available, low-\/level, high performance software packages such as Fast Fourier Transforms, dense and sparse linear algebra operations, etc, and the high-\/level data analysis pipelines, and thus to help the users to benefit from the former, while developing the latter in a more straightforward and transparent way. At the end of the project the library is supposed to provide functionality relevant to all main stages of the data analysis.
