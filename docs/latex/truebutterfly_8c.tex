Implementation of routines for butterfly-\/like communication scheme, with classic pair wise butterfly scheme.  


\subsection*{Functions}
\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
int \hyperlink{group__matmap__group22_ga5136d676330c6257fddf3c614e5cedcc}{truebutterfly\-\_\-init} (int $\ast$indices, int count, int $\ast$$\ast$R, int $\ast$n\-R, int $\ast$$\ast$S, int $\ast$n\-S, int $\ast$$\ast$com\-\_\-indices, int $\ast$com\-\_\-count, int steps, M\-P\-I\-\_\-\-Comm comm)
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Initialize tables for butterfly-\/like communication scheme (true means pair wise) This routine set up needed tables for the butterfly communication scheme. Sending and receiving tabs should be well allocated(at least size of number of steps in butterfly scheme). Double pointer are partially allocated, the last allocation is performed inside the routine. com\-\_\-indices and com\-\_\-count are also allocated inside the routine, thus they are passing by reference. They represent indices which have to be communicated an their number. Algotithm is based 2 parts. The first one identify intersection between processors indices, using 3 successives butterfly communication schemes \-: bottom up, top down, and top down again. The second part works locally to build sets of indices to communicate. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
double \hyperlink{group__matmap__group22_ga5198c5dcb4ff06c9b9cdd323398f1541}{truebutterfly\-\_\-reduce} (int $\ast$$\ast$R, int $\ast$n\-R, int n\-Rmax, int $\ast$$\ast$S, int $\ast$n\-S, int n\-Smax, double $\ast$val, int steps, M\-P\-I\-\_\-\-Comm comm)
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Perform a sparse sum reduction (or mapped reduction) using a butterfly-\/like communication scheme. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
